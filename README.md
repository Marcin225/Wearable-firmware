# Wearable Vital Signs Monitor  
  
A **wearable device prototype** for measuring vital signs and user activity, with planned mobile app integration.  
  
The device measures:  
  
- heart rate / HR,  
- blood oxygen saturation / SpO₂,  
- planned: steps, signal quality, and motion artefacts.  
  
The project runs on a **Seeed XIAO ESP32-C3**, uses **FreeRTOS**, **BLE** communication, and custom drivers and signal-processing algorithms.  
  
> The project is currently under development and will be updated regularly.

        ↓
Median filtering
        ↓
High-pass filtering
        ↓
Low-pass filtering
        ↓
AC/DC component extraction
        ↓
Peak detection + autocorrelation
        ↓
Heart rate estimation
        ↓
Ratio of Ratios calculation
        ↓
SpO₂ lookup table
        ↓
Result validation and smoothing
